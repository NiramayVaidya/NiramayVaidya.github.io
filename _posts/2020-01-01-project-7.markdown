title: Differentially Private Distributed Aggregation of Real Time Data Streams from Resource Constrained Healthcare IoT Edge Devices
duration: Jan'20 - July'20
domain: Data Privacy
description: Performed privacy preserving distributed data aggregation of heart rate values collected in real time from a personal fitness tracker like Xiaomi's MiBand 2 on a resource constrained processsing unit like an Arduino UNO board, with the assistance of an ESP32 WiFi Bluetooth Development board.
