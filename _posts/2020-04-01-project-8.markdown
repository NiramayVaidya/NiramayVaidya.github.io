title: Privacy Preserving Systolic Blood Pressure Prediction using Differentially Private Data
duration: Apr'20 - July'20
domain: Data Privacy
description: Performed privatization of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) prediction for Hemodialysis using the HEMOBP dataset. SBP is predicted using two models, multiple linear regression and Tensorflow based feed-forward neural network. The input to both these models is noised Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Hemodialysis sessions' time values, using the perturbation based Laplace mechanism under Differential Privacy (DP).
