title: Word Completion/Suggestion Feature in Gedit
duration: Aug'17 - Dec'17
domain: C and GTK Application Development
description: Used the GTK C library to provide this functionality in the default GNOME graphical text editor. A pull-up menu triggered on mouse click or via a keyboard shortcut press lists matches for the partial word typed in the editor window from a set of 20K English words in case of a plain text file. For C, C++, Java and Python files, it lists matching keywords of the respective coding languages.
