title: Analysis of Cache Metrics, Comparing Branch Predictors, Systolic Array Design
duration: Oct'21 - Dec'21
domain: Computer Architecture
description: Analyzed the impact of cache associativity and cache size on power consumption, area and access time using the cacti simulator. Compared the MPKI (Miss Predictions per 1000 Instructions) for 4 different branch predictors (BiModal, gShare, Hybrid and Yeh-Patt) using the branch predictor championship simulator. Designed a common optimal systolic array architecture for neural network workloads like AlphaGoZero, Faster-RCNN, VGG19 and Resnet50 using the scale-sim-v2 simulator to improve the required compute cycles and the hardware utilization.
