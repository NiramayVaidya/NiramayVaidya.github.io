description: Implemented a functionality in Java to push test metrics data to a web application by parsing html post the regression pack run and configured a Jenkins job to automate the same. Developed a solution for excel file version control while resolving merge conflicts. Fixed a limitation in the regression suite not running via Browserstack due to a local file dependency on the Jenkins slave node.
