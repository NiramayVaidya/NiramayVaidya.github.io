description: Developed a bare minimum IoT platform using a Mosquitto MQTT message broker to collect data from client nodes, Node-RED flows to establish data flows within the platform, MySQL time-series DB to store the input data organized using multiple tables, a rule engine to trigger appropriate actions based on the occurence of certain events, a REST API interface to easily connect to the platform and perform actions, and microservices to provide event and alert notifications capability.
