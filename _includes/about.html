                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a BTech Information Technology graduate from College of Engineering Pune (CoEP). I am a system programming and embedded programming enthusiast with particular interests in understanding computer architecture concepts and studying about related domains. I have been a member of CoEP's <a href="https://www.coep.org.in/csat/" style="color:darkcyan;">Student Satellite Team</a> (CSAT) and until recently, was the Communication Subsystem Lead there. I have worked on embedded systems during my time at CSAT. Having been involved in the ongoing research in cube satellite systems aimed towards designing CSAT's second satellite has been an exhilarating experience!</p>
